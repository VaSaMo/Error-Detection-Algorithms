# Error Detection Algorithms

This project was created for the Computing and Discrete Structures II class at ICESI University (Cali, Colombia). It was build using **Object-Oriented (OOP)** and **Functional** programing paradigms through **Scala**.

*Project was first built in a Github Classroom repository*

## Project description 

On this proyect it can be found the implementation of 2 error detection codes, to be more specific  CheckSum and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).

## Quality indicators

1. Error density = Total failures / Total tests.
2. Reliability = 1 - Error density.
3. Completeness = Test cases / Total functionalities.

### Functionalities
1. CheckSum
2. CRC
3. Upload Data
4. Read Data
5. Generate Data

### Results

| Indicator | Procedure	 | Result |
| ----------- |------------|--------|
| Error density | 0 / 64     | 0 %    |
| Reliability | 100 - 0    | 100 %  |
| Completeness | 64 / 5     | 12.8    |
